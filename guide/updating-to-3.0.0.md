The first Switch Homebrew Launcher has been released. It only runs on 3.0.0.

You must have an **update game**. This is a game used to update to a specific firmware version. We need to update to 3.0.0, so we recommend a cartridge of [Pokken Tournament DX](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?field-keywords=Pokken+Tournament+DX){:target=_blank}. Running this game should update you to 3.0.0, however be careful as some very recent copies come with 3.1.0. [Here's how to tell the difference](/more/pokken-tournament-dx).

## Instructions

1. Open System Settings and navigate to "Airplane Mode"
2. Enable Airplane Mode
3. Hold down the "Power" Button
4. Reboot while holding down **Volume +** and **Volume -**
5. Insert your **update game** cartridge into the Switch
6. Run the game
7. Update to 3.0.0 when prompted
8. Open System Settings and navigate to "Airplane Mode"
9. Disable Airplane Mode
