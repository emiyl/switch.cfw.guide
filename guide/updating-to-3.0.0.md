The first Switch Homebrew Launcher has been released. It only runs on 3.0.0.

You must have an **update game**. This is a game used to update to a specific firmware version. We need to update to 3.0.0, so we recommend a cartridge of [Pokken Tournament DX](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?field-keywords=Pokken+Tournament+DX){:target=_blank}. Running this game should update you to 3.0.0, however be careful as some very recent copies come with 3.1.0. [Here's how to tell the difference](/more/pokken-tournament-dx)

## Important

If you are on 1.0.0, waiting might be beneficial. CFW will be released first for 1.0.0, and then later versions. If you just can't wait to run homebrew, however, proceed.

## Instructions

1. Insert your **update game** cartridge into the Switch
2. Run the game
3. Update to 3.0.0 when prompted
