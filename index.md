<h2>What is homebrew and the Homebrew Launcher?</h2>
<p>Homebrew is custom, user-made software, which haven't been authorised by Nintendo. This can include save editing tools, games, emulators, and more. The Homebrew Launcher is a launcher you can install to your Switch to run these homebrew applications.</p>

<h2>What firmwares can I install homebrew on?</h2>
<p>Homebrew can be installed on Nintendo Switch system version 3.0.0. This guide will help you through installing homebrew on your Nintendo Switch console.</p>

<h2>Is this safe?</h2>
<p>It <i>should</i> be. Make sure to always run homebrew from trustworthy sources. I will not be held responsible for any damages done to your device.</p>

<h2>I'm on a version below 3.0.0. Can I install Homebrew?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can do this by <a href="/guide/updating-to-3.0.0">updating to 3.0.0</a> via an update game. However be warned that another exploit may be coming out in the future. Remember that if you are on a lower firmware, you will get CFW first.</p>

<h2>I'm above 3.0.0. What are my options?</h2>
<p>More advanced hacks will be available in the future. For now, <a href="/guide/blocking-updates">block updates</a> and have patience until they are ready to be released.</p>
