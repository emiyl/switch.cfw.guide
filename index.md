## What is homebrew and the Homebrew Launcher?
Homebrew is custom, user-made software, which haven't been authorised by Nintendo. This can include save editing tools, games, emulators, and more. The Homebrew Launcher is a launcher you can install to your Switch to run these homebrew applications.

## What firmwares can I install homebrew on?
Homebrew can be installed on Nintendo Switch system version 3.0.0 and below. This guide will help you through installing homebrew on your Nintendo Switch console.

## Is this safe?
It _should_ be. Make sure to always run homebrew from trustworthy sources. I will not be held responsible for any damages done to your device.

## I'm above 3.0.0. What are my options?
You cannot currently run the Homebrew Launcher, however there is a bootrom exploit which has been released. This will allow you to install CFW in the future.
